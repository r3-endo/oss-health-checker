When finishing a task:
1. Ensure task follows OpenSpec task item and update tasks.md checkbox.
2. Run focused tests first, then full project checks as needed.
3. Keep changes minimal and architecture-consistent (ports/adapters, typed domain models).
4. Report what changed, test results, and any blockers/design follow-ups.
