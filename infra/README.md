# Infra Skeleton

This directory holds operational assets for upcoming dockerization work.

- `compose/`: compose file templates and runtime wiring (to be added in next change)
- `env/`: environment variable templates
- `scripts/`: operational helper scripts

Dockerfile/compose implementation is intentionally out of scope for this change.
